# Indicate the range around the nominal frequency to be detected

# the nominal frequency are measured. Outside that range will give no reading.

# SAMPLES_PER_PERIOD:
# Smaller means less error in computation of frequency
# Since the 3rd harmonic is strong, it should always show up.
# For bass notes, the microphone also might attenuate the fundamental,
# with the result that the 3rd harmonic can be stronger than the fundamental,
# if not on the spectrum, it will produce aliasing artifacts near the 
# fundamental frequency that mess up the measurement.
# So the 3rd armonic should always be present in the spectrum.
# 3rd harmonic = 3 times the fundamental in Hz. Because of Nyquist Theorem,
# the harmonic needs at least 2 samples per period, so 3*2 = 6 as the
# smallest value for SAMPLES_PER_PERIOD if the 3rd harmonic is strong.
# i.e. SAMPLES_PER_PERIOD has to be > 6.
# If much larger, there will be a certain loss of precision, since the
# buffer size is fixed and the frequency resolution of the spectrum is
# 1/duration = 1/nominal_frequency/SAMPLES_PER_PERIOD, so if the duration
# is smaller, the frequency resolution suffers.
