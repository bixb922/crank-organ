# 2. MIDI vs. rolls/books

This is a topic of heated debates. Either you like one of the options or not. 

Music roll (or book) crank organs have an interesting mechanism to show to the public. But you can carry only so many rolls with you, and the cost of rolls tends to be higher.

MIDI lets you have many tunes in your organ. I have currently more than 500 tunes. I normally start with a setlist and then choose new tunes depending of the public's reaction. 


# 3. MIDI organ construction as compared to roll/book organs

MIDI crank organs share most of the construction details with roll/book organs, except they are simpler to build: you can skip the mechanism to move the paper roll, and you don't need to build the pneumatic valves for each pipe. They are more expensive, though, since you need to purchase valves.

I think it best to use proven organ valves. These are also called pallet valves. They are reliable, silent and don't consume much energy. See links of [electric organ valves](#links-electric-organ-valves)


I only have used the Peterson valves so far. They offer good support.

You can use very small solenoids to open air to control a pneumatic valve. It is much more work to get the pneumatic valves right. If you want to explore this way, look at this pneumatic valve: https://orgue-bernard.blog4ever.com/les-vmt-vannes-a-membrane-tangentielle. This is easier to build than many other types of pneumatic valves I've seen.

Here are many links about the topic of actuators to open the air flow of crank organ valves: https://orgue-bernard.blog4ever.com/le-bobinage-d-un-relais# (there is a box to select the languages on the upper left of the page). The discussion there is very thorough.

Some have used RC Servo motors (those used for radiocontrolled model airplanes or cars). I would like to test this and have no definitive results. I believe these may be to slow for fast and short notes. Paper roll based organs can handle 30 milliseconds on/30 milliseconds off repetition rates, while even the fastest RC servos need more time. Experimentation is the only way to solve this.

With non-MIDI organs, on many plans the pipes are connected with plastic tubes to the windchest. This is excellent to save space and completely appropriate for pneumatic valves. For MIDI organs, however, I think the easiest is to put the pallet valves direcly under the pipe foot, dispensing with tubes. There is also less chance of air escaping. It will be more difficult to fit the resulting windchest in a small space. I believe  the resulting organ will be a bit larger than using plastic tubes, but easier to build.

So essentially a MIDI crank organ has:
* Bellows and a pipe to send the pressurized air to the windchests
* Crank and crank shaft to move the bellows
* Windchest containing the pallet valves (a windchest is essentialy a sealed box where the pipes are mounted)
* Pipes, normally only bourdon (closed, gedackt) pipes
* The frame that holds all parts together
* The MIDI controller and the valve drivers (driver=current amplifier)
* And the decoration/outer walls

Optional crank organ elements are for example violin pipes, piccolo pipes, registers and percussion.

Optional electronic elements are for example crank sensor, electronic register buttons, microphone, touchpad. 

The rest of the crank organ elements have no difference with a regular crank organ.

# 4. Bellows and spring

The bellows is quite important, it has to supply a variable stream of air at constant pressure. There are many plans for bellows out there. By far the simplest but highly effective is Melvin Wright's bellow, look here http://www.melright.com/busker/jsmenu.htm

Instead of a typical torsion spring, I used a horizontal spring: http://www.melright.com/busker/jsart131.htm

The horizontal spring makes the complete construction smaller.

I used this spring from McMaster-Carr: https://www.mcmaster.com/
```
Music-Wire Steel Extension Spring
with Loop Ends, 2" Long, 0.75" OD, 0.049" Diameter, 8.36"
Extended
9044K421
lbs/inch=1.02
```
Of course, any other brand with the same specs will do. The spring must be good quality musical wire, also called piano wire. There is nothing musical with this wire, it's just the name since piano wires are of excellent quality.

Since the top of the bellows oscillates a bit, it is important to use the softest spring possible that gives the enough force, and to operate the spring at about 3/4 of the maximum extension. That way the oscillation of the top of the bellows has only little influence on the pressure.

I designed for 8 to 9 cmH2O pressure (about 780 Pascal), which is a relatively low pressure. Anyhow the sound fills a room completely and is enough for outside too. 

# 5. Pipes

Pipe dimensions for a 20 Note crank organ, plus excellent instructions are here in german: https://bluemich.net/drehorgel/beijer/index.htm

Here is a spreadsheed with pipe measurements (german: Mensuren): [spreadsheed](/building/pipe_dimensions.xlsx). On second sheet in the file are some explanations. The original is here: https://orgue-bernard.blog4ever.com/, open the Downloads section. The original is way better than my simplified version. 

This is one of the simplest ways to make a pipe foot: http://www.melright.com/busker/jsart136.htm

I made the walls of the pipes of balsa wood. It is very easy to cut. But beware: balsa is very porous and needs 3 or 4 layers of varnish to seal. Even the smallest pore makes the sound dull. I used water based polyurethane varnish, since it is easy to get and to handle. Shellac is also traditionally used for musical instruments and pipes.

The easiest stopper is this one: https://orgue-bernard.blog4ever.com/les-tampons-en-silicone. As with all pages of this site, use the translation box provided by the page. The stopper works well with balsa wood pipes since the pressure of the stopper does not need to be strong for a good seal. Traditional leather (chamois) and wood stoppers can break balsa easily (and can even break strong wood).

Another aspect of the pipes that I found important are the "ears": some pipes have small walls on each side of the mouth. They need to be a few millimeters wide only. They alter the sound of the attack. If not present, the pipe makes a thhwwt sound before the note sound (german: Die Pfeife spuckt). For many builders, this sound can be desirable, since it gives a percussive quality to the sound. With the ears present, this percussion is much lower.



# 6. Crank

This crank organ build log has good ideas to make a crank: http://organcrank.blogspot.com/2012_12_16_archive.htmlhttp://organcrank.blogspot.com/2012_12_16_archive.html

You need an axis. The diameter should be 8 mm or larger. 10mm and even 15mm are sometimes used. It should be good quality steel. The axis is best kept in place with two ball bearings. The crank shaft needs to be long enough to move the central board of the bellows from one extreme to the other, minus some slack. If the slack is too small, the bellows can be pushed too hard and be damaged.

I used this one: https://www.mcmaster.com/products/rotary-shafts/shafts-3~/keyed-rotary-shafts-5/diameter~8-mm/length~300-mm/

In my photo gallery: https://drehorgel.pythonanywhere.com/iot/static/gallery.html are some photos that show my crank construction.


# 7. MIDI Files

## How to get MIDI files

In the links above there are some free MIDI files for crank organs.

MIDI files abound on the Internet. Before the age of MP3 files, MIDI files were the preferred medium (or better: only medium) to share music on the internet. For example, there are veritable treasure chests of MIDI files in the old Geocities archives. Nowadays there are hundreds of sites that offer (seemingly) free MIDI files (although: All music creation has copyrights. Downloading a file for free does not mean these restrictions ceased to exist.  Make sure you know your local laws and regulations.)

It is quite difficult to adapt most of these files to the crank organ. The issues are:
* MIDI files rely on all the sounds for their effect: drums, strings, reverb, chorus, etc. On the crank organ, we have normally only one voice: the pipes, or perhaps some registers. Normally no percussion. Most effects get lost and the nice sound disappears.
* The crank organ has a limited scale. MIDI files normally span 3 or 4 octaves and use all notes. See links above for crank organ scales. There are simply too many different notes for a crank organ! And many notes will be missing.
* Many MIDI files rely on long notes (think strings). That does not translate well to crank organs, where short notes and runs are more effective.
* The style does not fit the crank organ. Crank organs are at their best if you exploit their sound capabilites, and they have a typical style: bass on the strong notes (no walking bass), countermelodies and ornaments. Although typical for crank organs, these elements are normally not found on MIDI files.


## Purchase MIDI files

If you don't have any music theory background, this may be a very good option. See the links [here](#purchase-midi-files).

## Adapt existing MIDI files

A good starting point are MIDI files already made for mechanical music, see [here](#midi-files). There are large archives of digitized piano rolls and even hundreds or thousands of organ rolls, that provide a more suitable starting point. MIDI files played on piano could be a reasonable starting point too. MIDI files with many different instrument, lots of percussion and long notes are notoriously difficult to adapt.

You'll have to transpose these files to fit the organ's scale and then cut notes or transpose notes by one octave into the range of the organ. And then you'll have to hear if the result is ok for your ears. The result may be satisfactory for your taste... or not. Ornamentations such as trills and runs or countermelodies can enhance the tune a lot! Bass lines of available MIDI files are normally too complex for a crank organ. 

Simple bass has short notes on beat 1 and 4 plus some runs when the chord changes. This design of bass lines is very appropriate for crank organs.  Walking bass or complex bass lines are not apt for crank organs with 20 note or 31 note scales.

Editing of these files is done in a MIDI file editor that provides piano roll format, see [here](#midi-file-editors-for-crank-organs). Conversion from MIDI to music scores is normally not satisfactory. 

## Write your own arrangement

This is a very good article by arranger Harald Müller about arrangements for crank organs: https://www.haraldmmueller.de/arrrm_en.htm

Here is an example of what Harald does for a specific tune: https://www.mmdigest.com/Gallery/Sounds/mueller1.html
