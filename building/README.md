# 2. MIDI vs. rolls/books

This is a topic of heated debates. Either you like one of the options or not. 

Music roll (or book) crank organs have an interesting mechanism to show to the public. But you can carry only so many rolls with you, and the cost of rolls tends to be higher.

MIDI lets you have many tunes in your organ. I have currently more than 500 tunes. I normally start with a setlist and then choose new tunes depending of the public's reaction. 


# 3. MIDI organ construction as compared to roll/book organs

MIDI crank organs share most of the construction details with roll/book organs, except they are simpler to build: you can skip the mechanism to move the paper roll, and you don't need to build the pneumatic valves for each pipe. They are more expensive, though, since you need to purchase valves.

I think it best to use proven organ valves. These are also called pallet valves. They are reliable, silent and don't consume much energy. Examples are:
* Peterson (http://www.petersonemp.com/products/pdf/seriesii.pdf, with specs here: http://www.petersonemp.com/manuals/manuals/Pipe%20Valves/Pipe%20Valve%20performance%20chart%20revised%2008-14-2014.pdf) 
* Reisner OSI (https://www.organsupply.com/product-catalog/electrical/). 

I only have used the Peterson valves so far. They offer good support.

You can use very small solenoids to open air to control a pneumatic valve. It is much more work to get the pneumatic valves right. If you want to explore this way, look at this pneumatic valve: https://orgue-bernard.blog4ever.com/les-vmt-vannes-a-membrane-tangentielle. This is easier to build than many other types of pneumatic valves I've seen.

Here are many links about the topic of actuators to open the air flow of crank organ valves: https://orgue-bernard.blog4ever.com/le-bobinage-d-un-relais# (there is a box to select the languages on the upper left of the page). The discussion there is very thorough.

Some have used RC Servo motors (those used for radiocontrolled model airplanes or cars). I would like to test this and have no definitive results. I believe these may be to slow for fast and short notes. Paper roll based organs can handle 30 milliseconds on/30 milliseconds off repetition rates, while even the fastest RC servos need more time. Experimentation is the only way to solve this.

With non-MIDI organs, on many plans the pipes are connected with plastic tubes to the windchest. This is excellent to save space and completely appropriate for pneumatic valves. For MIDI organs, however, I think the easiest is to put the pallet valves direcly under the pipe foot, dispensing with tubes. There is also less chance of air escaping. It will be more difficult to fit the resulting windchest in a small space. I believe  the resulting organ will be a bit larger than using plastic tubes, but easier to build.

# 4. Bellows and spring

The bellows is quite important, it has to supply a variable stream of air at constant pressure. There are many plans for bellows out there. By far the simplest but highly effective is Melvin Wright's bellow, look here http://www.melright.com/busker/jsmenu.htm

Instead of a typical torsion spring, I used a horizontal spring: http://www.melright.com/busker/jsart131.htm

The horizontal spring makes the complete construction smaller.

I used this spring from McMaster-Carr: https://www.mcmaster.com/
```
Music-Wire Steel Extension Spring
with Loop Ends, 2" Long, 0.75" OD, 0.049" Diameter, 8.36"
Extended
9044K421
lbs/inch=1.02
```
Of course, any other brand with the same specs will do. The spring must be good quality musical wire (piano wire).

Since the top of the bellows oscillates a bit, it is important to use the softest spring possible that gives the enough force, and to operate the spring at about 3/4 of the maximum extension. That way the oscillation of the top of the bellows has only little influence on the pressure.

I designed for 8 to 9 cmH2O pressure (about 780 Pascal), which is a relatively low pressure. Anyhow the sound fills a room completely and is enough for outside too.

# 5. Build pipes

Here is a spreadsheed with pipe measurements (german: Mensuren): [spreadsheed](pipe_dimensions.xls). On second sheet in the file are some explanations. The original is here: https://orgue-bernard.blog4ever.com/, open the Downloads section. The original is way better than my simplified version. 

This is one of the simplest ways to make a block: http://www.melright.com/busker/jsart136.htm

I don't have a band saw. So I made a similar pipe foot block out of wood with a small table saw. Later I found out that the exact shape of the inner chamber in the pipe foot is not very relevant (it sure is for a large church organ). So a even easier pipe foot is:
* One block for the foot where the toe pipe goes (i.e. at the bottom of the pipe). This needs to be 1.5cm in height so the toe pipe fits well in. The width and depth are according to the spreadsheet (interior width).
* A second block to form the windsheet (the small slit where the air exits in front of the mouth), also called air band.  Same width and depth as first block.
* A third block to keep the walls in place while gluing. This block is then thrown away.

Maybe someday I make a drawing.

# 6. Crank

This crank organ has good ideas to make a crank: http://organcrank.blogspot.com/2012_12_16_archive.htmlhttp://organcrank.blogspot.com/2012_12_16_archive.html

You need an axis. 8 mm of good steel is enough. The axis is best kept in place with two ball bearings. The crank shaft needs to be long enough to move the central board of the bellows from one extreme to the other, minus some slack.

In my photo gallery: https://drehorgel.pythonanywhere.com/iot/static/gallery.html are some photos that show my crank construction.




# 7. How to get MIDI files

In the links above there are some free MIDI files for crank organs.

MIDI files abound on the Internet. Before the advent of the MP3 files, MIDI files were the preferred medium (or better: only medium) to share music on the internet! For example, there are veritable treasure chests of MIDI files in the old Geocities archives.

It is quite difficult to adapt most of these files to the crank organ. The issues are:
* MIDI files rely on all the sounds for their effect: drums, strings, reverb, chorus, etc. On the crank organ, we have normally only one voice: the pipes, or perhaps some registers. Normally no percussion. Most effects get lost and the nice sound disappears.
* The crank organ has a limited scale. MIDI files normally span 3 or 4 octaves and use all notes. See links above for crank organ scales. There are simply too many different notes for a crank organ! And many notes will be missing.
* Many MIDI files rely on long notes (think strings). That does not translate well to crank organs, where short notes and runs are more effective.
* The style does not fit the crank organ. Crank organs are at their best if you exploit its sound capabilites, and they have a typical style: bass on the strong notes (no walking bass), countermelodies and ornaments. Although typical for crank organs, these elements are in most cases not found on MIDI files.


# 8. Purchase MIDI files

If you don't have any music theory background, this may be a very good option. See the links above.

# 9. Adapt existing MIDI files

A good starting point are MIDI files already made for mechanical music, here are some sources:
* https://www.mmdigest.com/ see archives section
* http://www.pianorollmusic.org/rolldatabase.php more than 10000 digitized piano and organ rolls. Most are 100 years or older.
* https://midimusic.github.io/ many Wurlitzer, fairground organs  i.e. for organs with 31 notes or more.
* MIDI files played by someone on organ or piano. These, at least, are made for only one instrument, so there is less to remove.

You'll have to transpose these files to fit the organ's scale and cut notes or transpose notes by one octave into the range of the organ. And then you'll have to hear if the result is ok for your ears. The result may be satisfactory for your taste... or not. Ornamentations such as trills and runs or countermelodies can enhance the tune, but then we are already arranging. 

MIDI files downloaded from the internet can be quite difficult to convert to a music score. These files are best edited in a so-called "piano roll" view. See the links for some free MIDI file editors.


# 10. Write your own arrangement

This is a good article by arranger Harald Müller about arrangements for crank organs: https://www.haraldmmueller.de/arrrm_en.htm

Here is an example of what Harald does for a specific tune: https://www.mmdigest.com/Gallery/Sounds/mueller1.html
